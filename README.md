# ZAALIMA-INTERNSHIP-PROJECT-2-
CUSTOMER SEGMETATION 

üìä Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
Project Overview
This project utilizes unsupervised machine learning (K-Means Clustering) to segment a customer base into distinct groups based on demographic and behavioral data (Age and Estimated Salary). The primary goal is to provide data-driven insights that can inform and enable targeted marketing strategies, optimizing resource allocation and improving conversion rates.

Methodology
The analysis follows a standard data science pipeline:

Data Loading & EDA: Initial data inspection confirms 400 complete records with no missing values. Features include Gender, Age, EstimatedSalary, and the binary target variable Purchased.

Pre-processing: The key features for clustering, Age and EstimatedSalary, were scaled using MinMaxScaler to ensure equal weighting during the clustering process.

Clustering: The K-Means algorithm was applied, identifying an optimal number of 4 clusters (K=4).

Cluster Profiling: Each segment was analyzed based on its average characteristics to define marketing personas.

üí° Key Findings & Segment Profiles (K=4)
The clustering revealed four distinct customer segments, each requiring a different marketing approach:

Cluster ID	Avg. Age	Avg. Salary	Purchase Rate	Marketing Persona & Strategy
1	44.1	$121,654	86.4%	Affluent High-Value Targets: Highly engaged, high-income customers. Strategy: Focus on premium offerings, loyalty programs, and relationship maintenance.
3	51.0	$41,955	83.3%	Older Budget Buyers: Older, lower-income segment with a high tendency to purchase. Strategy: Emphasize product value, necessity, and non-price benefits.
0	35.8	$71,146	11.4%	General Population/Non-Buyers: Moderately aged and salaried customers who have mostly not purchased. Strategy: General awareness campaigns and mid-tier product pitches.
2	26.0	$42,453	0.0%	Young Non-Buyers: Youngest demographic with the lowest purchase rate. Strategy: Marketing aimed at future conversion, focusing on brand building and affordability options.
